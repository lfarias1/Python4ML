# Python4ML
A little documentation of my experience in Machine Learning using Python.

The objective of this repository is to show some of the things that helped me learn Machine Learning. This will contain a notebook about Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Keras, and other libraries that I may yet discover. I hope it helps anyone who's starting their journey through Machine Learning.
